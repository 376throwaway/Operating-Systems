# String Manipulation Functions and Linked List Operations
Develop a few string manipulation functions similar to the standard C string functions. Not allowed to use any standard string functions (e.g., strcpy, strlen, etc) in your code

Implement several functions that create and manipulate a linked list, each function (other than sort) should not alter the item value of nodes in the linked list
