# String Manipulation Functions and Linked List Operations
Develop a few string manipulation functions similar to the standard C string functions, without use any standard string functions (e.g., strcpy, strlen, etc)

Implement several functions that create and manipulate a linked list, functions (other than sort) do not not alter the item value of nodes in the linked list but rather redirect pointers
